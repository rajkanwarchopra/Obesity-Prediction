# Obesity-Prediction

# Business Problem:

A Portuguese bank is gearing up to launch a term deposit subscription marketing campaign. The bank has data from a past marketing campaign, which will be used to offer insights to make a focused and successful campaign, so that bank will save a lot of money, time and resources. Additionally, we have created machine learning models to forecast the outcome for a potential future customer. 

# Dataset:

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

There are four datasets:
1) bank-additional-full.csv with all examples (41188) and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010), very close to the data analyzed in [Moro et al., 2014]

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).
